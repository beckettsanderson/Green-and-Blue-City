# DS4200_Green-and-Blue-City-Project-
The prevalence of green and blue spaces in city atmospheres is on the rise with the benefits provided to socialization, relaxation, and mental health for the public. As an important factor in the wellbeing of a community, understanding their influence is key.

Our stakeholders, members of the Mass Ave Coalition, are wisely interested in the green and blue spaces around them. One of the three main focuses of the Coalition is streetscape as they speak about the “need to improve our physical space that can connect residents, businesses, musical venues, medical and educational institutions.” This information will be important to the evolution of their goals and neighborhood improvements.

The goals for this project are to provide information about green and blue spaces both in the neighborhood of Mass Ave specifically as well as for the whole of Boston. Tree and open space data is the largest focus for our task group, but the project will cover a range of spaces in the Mass Ave neighborhood.
